# Story Specs

## Sources of Truth

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Product behavior and principles | [`production/story-production.md`](./production/story-production.md) |
| MVP scope and build sequence | [`implementation-plan/mvp-build-plan.md`](./implementation-plan/mvp-build-plan.md) |
| Shared data contracts (authoritative) | [`implementation-plan/02-core-story-schema.md`](./implementation-plan/02-core-story-schema.md) |

## Current Milestone

**Alpha 0.1** — DIRECT + EDIT walking skeleton with mocked AI, running end-to-end on a physical iPhone.

See `mvp-build-plan.md` for the acceptance criteria and build sequence.

## Rule

Do not implement capabilities from `production/story-production.md` unless they are explicitly included in `mvp-build-plan.md`. The production spec is the long-term vision. The build plan is what gets built now.
