# Async Edit Planning — SHARED CONTRACT (build against this; do not diverge)

All three workstreams (CDK infra / backend job API + worker / iOS client) depend ONLY on this contract.
Owner-approved 2026-10-13. Dev only. No push, no public deploy.

## Resource names (CDK owns; backend + worker reference by env)
- DynamoDB table:  `story-{env}-edit-plan-jobs`   (PK: `job_id` S).  TTL attr: `expires_at` (epoch s).
- SQS queue:       `story-{env}-edit-plan-jobs`     + DLQ `story-{env}-edit-plan-jobs-dlq` (maxReceiveCount 2).
- S3 staging:      `story-{env}-edit-plan-staging-{account}-{region}`  (private, SSE, lifecycle expire 24h).
- Lambda worker:   `story-{env}-edit-plan-worker`   (timeout 900s; reserved concurrency 5).
- Env wired into App Runner + Lambda: STORY_JOBS_TABLE, STORY_JOBS_QUEUE_URL, STORY_STAGING_BUCKET.

## Job states (DynamoDB `status`)
queued -> running -> completed | failed
queued|running + cancel_requested -> cancelled
any non-terminal past expires_at -> expired (TTL + reconcile)
Terminal: completed, failed, cancelled, expired. Transitions are CONDITIONAL writes (no backward moves).

## DynamoDB item schema
job_id (S, uuid)              operation_id (S, idempotency key — SAME op recovers SAME job)
owner (S)                     status (S)
created_at (N, epoch s)       updated_at (N)
expires_at (N, TTL)           attempt_count (N)
lease_until (N, worker exec lease; a redelivery past lease may re-run)
approach (S: storytelling|visual_first)   critique_requested (BOOL)
request_ref (M: {staging_prefix, sheet_order, has_body})   # body JSON stored in staging too (can be large)
failure_category (S, nullable: material_infeasible|planning_defect|provider_exhausted|invalid_after_repair|internal)
failure_detail (S, nullable, <=400)
plan (M, nullable: the validated EditPlan/2 contract JSON when completed)
diagnostics (M, nullable: planning_mode, sheet_count, critique_applied, model_calls, used_fallback)

## HTTP API (App Runner; new)
POST /v1/edit-plan-jobs    (multipart, SAME parts as /v1/edit-plan-mm + operation_id + owner)
  parts: operation_id(form,required), owner(form,required), body(form JSON), sheet_order(form JSON),
         creative_brief(form?), critique_revision(form bool?), approach(form), sheets[](files?)
  -> 202 {job_id, status:"queued"}      (idempotent: same operation_id returns the EXISTING job_id)
  App Runner work: validate+size-check sheets -> write them + body to S3 staging prefix -> conditional-put
     job (attribute_not_exists(operation_id) via a GSI OR a deterministic job_id = hash(operation_id)) ->
     enqueue SQS {job_id}. Returns FAST (<5s), no model call.
GET  /v1/edit-plan-jobs/{job_id}   -> {job_id,status,approach,failure_category?,failure_detail?,
                                        plan? (only when completed), diagnostics?}
POST /v1/edit-plan-jobs/{job_id}/cancel -> {status:"cancel_requested"|terminal}  (conditional)

## Idempotency + reliability
- job_id = deterministic UUIDv5(operation_id) so a duplicate POST maps to the SAME item (no dup job, no dup
  inference). "Create Another Version" => NEW operation_id => new job.
- Lost-enqueue recovery: a job stuck `queued` with no SQS progress past RECONCILE_AFTER (e.g. 60s) is re-enqueued
  by a reconcile sweep (EventBridge-scheduled Lambda tick OR worker self-heal). Minimal: a periodic reconcile.
- SQS at-least-once: worker takes a LEASE (conditional set lease_until); a redelivery while lease is live and
  status=running is dropped; after lease expiry a re-run is allowed (idempotent — overwrites result). We do
  NOT claim exactly-once inference; we claim no DUPLICATE completed-plan churn and bounded re-execution.
- Daily-token exhaustion: worker does NOT retry it as transient -> fail fast with failure_category=provider_exhausted
  (Opus->Sonnet fallback still applies first via the existing gateway).

## Worker (Lambda) — reuses the EXACT backend core
- Reads job -> loads body+sheets from S3 staging -> builds EditPlanInputs (images, creative_brief,
  image_moment_order, critique_revision) -> calls the SAME _execute_edit_plan / engine.generate path
  (frozen v5.2, EditPlan/2 validator, Opus->Sonnet fallback, bounded critique). Execution deadline 840s
  (< Lambda 900s).
- On success: conditional-put status=completed + plan + diagnostics, DELETE staging prefix.
- On terminal failure: status=failed + category/detail, DELETE staging prefix.
- Always deletes staged sheets on terminal (privacy); S3 lifecycle 24h is the backstop; a scheduled sweep
  deletes abandoned prefixes whose job is terminal/expired.

## Privacy / retention (the approved departure from ephemeral-only)
- ONLY derived JPEG contact sheets + the request body JSON are staged — NEVER original video.
- Private bucket, SSE (SSE-S3 or KMS), no public URLs, scoped IAM (App Runner put; worker get+delete only on
  the staging prefix). No image bytes in any log. Explicit delete on terminal + 24h lifecycle backstop + sweep.
- Retention: minutes in the normal case (deleted at job completion); 24h hard cap via lifecycle.

## iOS
- One creation path: submit job -> persist job_id (+ operation_id) locally -> poll GET with bounded backoff ->
  on completed, fetch plan -> render on-device (unchanged MediaEngineV1). Recover after restart via stored
  job_id. Try-Again reuses the SAME operation_id (no dup inference) unless it's a new version.
- Honest progress stages from status (queued/running/…); never show a raw 502 as a creative failure.
