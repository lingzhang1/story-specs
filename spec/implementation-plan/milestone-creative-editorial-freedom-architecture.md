# Creative Editorial Freedom & User-Directed Editing — Architecture Study

Status: **Design study + bounded A/B complete. STOP at the owner architecture/freeze gate.**
No production default change, no prompt freeze. `5.2-exp` is an experiment-only prompt (NOT
default); dev backend reverted to `5.1`. Nothing pushed.

Owner principle: **AI has creative freedom by default; the user has final editorial authority.**
NO fixed style templates (Dynamic/Cinematic/Natural) as the core architecture.

## 1. Artistic-constraint audit (Phase 1)
In v5/v5.1, the clause that unnecessarily constrains creative judgment is
**SIGNIFICANCE-WEIGHTED SCREEN TIME**, specifically "Prefer fewer well-chosen Moments held long
enough to read over many equally short clips." This is a **long-hold bias** that, measured earlier,
FIGHTS breadth at generous durations (Girl-with-Dress 100s used only ~9-16 of 36 genuinely-distinct
moments). It is an **artistic** preference, not a technical necessity.

Must-KEEP technical invariants (NOT touched): EXECUTABILITY INVARIANTS (source-range validity,
output=span/speed, ±20% total, transitions), DURATION DISCIPLINE (target authoritative, no pad),
native-audio policy, source-grounding ("never invent footage"), and continuous-performance
preservation. These are the floor; freedom lives above them.

## 2. Human reference (Phase 2)
Owner's ~60s / 20+-clip human edit of Girl with Dress was not available as a file to measure, so
this is reported as a limitation; the real footage ground truth (two outfits, red bag, ~10
locations, 4-6s human-cut pace) stands in as the target. Guitar Practice is the counterexample: a
continuous performance that must keep one long hold. Neither is made a template.

## 3. User-instruction taxonomy (Phase 3) — additive request object, NO EditPlan/2 change
Proposed `user_directives` on the edit-plan REQUEST (optional; absent = full AI freedom):
| directive | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `must_include: [moment_id]` | HARD | these Moments must appear |
| `exclude: [moment_id]` | HARD | never use these |
| `include_all: bool` | HARD | use every usable Moment (subject to duration feasibility) |
| `opening: moment_id` / `ending: moment_id` | HARD | first/last Moment |
| `order: [moment_id]` | HARD (partial) | relative order of the named Moments |
| `locked: [{moment_id, source_start, source_end}]` | HARD | preserve these exact segments |
| `target_duration_seconds` | HARD | already exists in CreativeIntent |
| `music_only: bool` | HARD | re-soundtrack only, reuse visual edit (already shipped as Change Music) |
| `preferences: free text` | SOFT | flexible creative steering ("start energetic", "more of the green dress") |
References resolve against ALL source Moments (including omitted footage); thumbnail selection maps
directly to `moment_id`, natural language maps to soft `preferences` + resolved ids. Hard vs soft is
explicit: hard = validated/enforced; soft = steering the AI retains freedom over.

## 4. Constraint validators (Phase 4) — deterministic, around existing EditPlan/2
Add checks (client or backend, post-plan, pre-render) that each HARD directive is satisfied:
must-include present; excluded absent; include-all coverage (modulo feasibility); opening/ending
Moment correct; required partial order respected; locked segments present with exact ranges; plus
the EXISTING source-range/duration/native-audio invariants. On conflict (e.g. must_include + a
duration too short to fit) → report the specific conflict + smallest resolution (drop the lowest-
priority soft item, or surface "these can't all fit in Ns"); NEVER silently drop a user requirement.

## 5. Creative-planning A/B (Phase 5) — v5.1 vs 5.2-exp (freedom candidate)
`5.2-exp` = v5.1 verbatim with the one significance clause rebalanced to **creative freedom over
pacing** (no long-hold bias; favor breadth when footage is distinct + intent is variety/journey;
favor continuous holds when the footage centers on a performance/payoff). Confirmed live
(`prompt_version=edit_plan/5.2-exp`). Identical footage/intent/duration/mode/evidence.

| fixture | v5.1 | 5.2-exp |
|---|---|---|
| Girl-with-Dress 100s full | ~9-16 unique | **22 unique**, 4-6s shots (broad, varied) |
| Guitar 45s (continuous) | 6/6 | **6/6, incl. a 25s continuous hold** |
| Solitude 30s | 3/3 | 3/3 (long calm holds) |
| Redundant 30s | 12/12 | 12/12 (near-dup padding — residual) |

**Both edit types emerge from the material, not a template:** a 22-shot fashion edit AND a 6-shot
performance edit, from the same planner. This is the owner's principle realized.

## 6. Quality (Phase 6)
- Shot-duration distribution: Girl 4-6s (varied, appropriate), Guitar 3-25s (one long payoff), Solitude 7-12s (patient) — all material-driven, not uniform.
- Visual variety + meaningful coverage: Girl now spans both outfits + many locations.
- Continuous-action preservation: Guitar's performance kept as one 25s hold. ✅
- Native-audio / duration / executability: all feasible, invariants unchanged.
- NOT optimizing raw count or randomness; redundant control still pads (separate dedup concern).

## 7. Architecture recommendation (Phase 7)
**Smallest reliable creative architecture = (1) ONE creative Edit Planner with richer context +
creative-pacing freedom  +  (3) a deterministic constraint validator around existing EditPlan/2 for
user directives.** NOT fixed style templates; NOT a creative→revision two-stage pass (unneeded — one
planner already produces both edit types); NOT a full timeline editor.
- The freedom amendment (5.2-exp) is the planner half.
- `user_directives` (additive request object) + the Phase-4 validators are the authority half.
- EditPlan/2 output contract, native-audio policy, and executability invariants all unchanged.

## 8. Contract implications
EditPlan/2 OUTPUT: no change. REQUEST: one additive optional `user_directives` object (back-compat;
absent = today's behavior). Prompt: the 5.2-exp pacing-freedom amendment, versioned, owner-gated.

## 9. Cost & latency
A/B + fixtures: a handful of edit-plan calls (~15-22s each), well under the $20 gate. No per-render
latency change (same single Opus call).

## 10. Recommended next implementation milestone (owner decision)
1. **Freeze the creative-freedom prompt** (promote 5.2-exp → a real versioned v5.2) after a device render confirms the Girl-with-Dress breadth + Guitar long-hold both hold on real footage.
2. **Then** implement `user_directives` (request object) + the deterministic validators — this is the "user has final authority" half, and the foundation for the Figma feedback/revision UX and future Natural-Language Refinement.
Residual (separate, owner-scoped-out): near-duplicate padding under Full → an optional dedup heuristic later.

STOP for owner approval before freezing the prompt or building the directives layer.
