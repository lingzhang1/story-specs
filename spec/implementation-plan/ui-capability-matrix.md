# UI Capability Matrix — frozen Figma surfaces vs implemented capability

**Purpose:** every capability the frozen Figma UX (`prototypes/story-figma/src/App.tsx`)
presents, with its current backend status, why it is disabled if it is, the
dependency, and the milestone expected to enable it. A future milestone that
implements a capability MUST, in its Definition of Done, enable the corresponding
Figma UI here and flip the row.

**Frozen Figma artifact:** `prototypes/story-figma/src/App.tsx` (4730 lines, single
Figma Make export, git `ba88526`). No competing version.

**Phase 7 fidelity status (2026-10-02):** every row below was re-verified against
actual native iPhone renders (product-presentation mode) laid beside the actual
Figma renders — not "a view exists". Fonts (Fraunces + DM Sans) are now bundled
(SIL OFL), image-forward composition matches, and the DIRECT shot card is scene-
backed. The remaining non-MATCHED rows are all DISABLED-future capabilities whose
*surface* is present and faithful; their *capability* is future work (tracked).
See `c35-phase7-fidelity-audit.md` for the screen-by-screen side-by-side.

**Legend — Capability:** IMPLEMENTED · PARTIAL · NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
**UI treatment at C3.5:** WIRED (real) · DISABLED (visible, non-interactive) ·
DEBUG_ONLY · EMPTY_STATE.
**Figma parity:** MATCHED · PARTIAL · MISSING · REAL_SYSTEM_EXTENSION. C3.5
Definition of Done requires **zero unexplained MISSING rows** — every MISSING must
carry a dependency + target milestone.

| **Skip scan** (shoot immediately) | Screen3Scene / ShotScreen skip | IMPLEMENTED (C3C) | WIRED | MATCHED | intro "Skip Scan" (secondary) → opens the camera DIRECTLY: no scene scan, no Director call, no ~10s wait, no recommendation/concept. Captured clip runs C4-Lite integrity → Moment. (Server still tolerates a null-scene Director call, but Skip Scan no longer uses it — avoids the 10s wait + any fabricated concept.) | — | **done (C3C)** |
| **Capture integrity check (C4-Lite)** | Screen8Validation (reused: Saved / Try again) | NOT_IMPLEMENTED | DISABLED | MISSING | local-only integrity gate (duration + file-readable; exposure/shake/focus only if they earn it on T01).

| **Story Guide / arc ("what I'll look for")** | ScreenStoryBlueprint / ScreenTMB Guide | NOT_IMPLEMENTED (no StoryBlueprint model) | DISABLED (neutral unavailable state — NOT TMB demo copy) | PARTIAL | no persistent StoryBlueprint intelligence; Figma TMB chapters/categories are demonstration content, not production-generated | StoryBlueprint/Guide milestone | later |
| **Story Idea passive suggestion** | ScreenTMB "✦ Story Idea" | NOT_IMPLEMENTED | DISABLED (neutral unavailable state — NOT TMB demo copy) | PARTIAL | needs persistent-Story orchestration; TMB "A moment together" is demo content | Story Guide milestone | later |

## Note — "MISSING" means a surface omission, not a future capability (review clarification)
Per the C3.5 acceptance clarification: a row may stay **capability = NOT_IMPLEMENTED**
and still satisfy the Definition of Done *as long as its frozen Figma surface is
present natively* (disabled or empty state), with dependency + target milestone
tracked here. The `MISSING` parity values above are **capability-level** notes for
the owning future milestone — the corresponding *surface* IS rendered natively in
C3.5 (e.g. Shot Validation has no screen because it has no trigger until C4 wires
the loop; Music/Create/Reference render as intentional disabled sections). No frozen
Figma surface is absent from the native product merely because its backend is future
work. The one deliberate structural omission — the post-capture Validation screen —
is documented in the fidelity audit as "no entry point until C4" rather than shipped
as a dead view.

## Note on Story Guide / Story Idea (review correction)
The frozen Figma Story Guide chapters (Departure / On the Trail / Scale / …) and the
"✦ Story Idea — A moment together" card are **TMB demonstration content**, not
production-generated personalized Story content. C3.5 preserves their Figma
structure and visual hierarchy but renders them in a **neutral, clearly
unavailable** state (e.g. a muted "Story Guide — coming soon" treatment), NEVER
pasting the TMB copy over an arbitrary Story as if it were real guidance.

## Rule
When a milestone implements any NOT_IMPLEMENTED/PARTIAL row, it must: (1) wire the
corresponding Figma surface, (2) flip the row here to IMPLEMENTED/WIRED, (3) note
the enabling milestone. This file is the single source of "what's intentionally
disabled and why" so no frozen capability is silently dropped.
